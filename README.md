# COSC1560
During the spring of 2021, I was finishing my senior year at Webster University, with a Bachelor of Arts in Interactive Digital Media. I originally picked it because of it's media production side, but I ended up falling in love with software development. This class was COSC 1560, Programming II. It's in cpp, and it covers pointers, sorting algorithms, structures, classes, file manipulation, etc.

You can basically learn from my mistakes, or do the assignment better than I did. :-)

I've included most of the actual assignment documents so you can try it for yourself.
